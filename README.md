We have 2 classes in this project:

Class "Car": which Defines the structure of a Car with attributes like id, make, model, etc and initials its variables.


Class "Main": which creats an array of several objects of the car class with different information in the form of objects and store them in an array.


This Class have 4 methods:

a) The method "getCarsByMake" to filter and save cars of a given brand to a file:



b) The method "getCarsByModelAndAge" to filter and save cars of a given model that have been in use for more than n years



c) The method "getCarsByYearAndPrice" to filter and save cars of a given year of manufacture, the price of which is higher than the specified one



d) The method "saveCarsToFile" to save all cars to a file



Finally, in the main class, these methods are called with sample variables to see the result of their functions.
